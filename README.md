# docker_webinar
To host code and examples for the BDR Docker webinar

Please see the 'docker_example' folder for all the examples used during the webinar, where you can retrace the steps taken using the webinar_commands.sh file (plus a little bonus showcasing the usage of a reverse proxy over TLS with better security practices for your API).

The other folders in this repo showcase the use of a Flask API with a Vue frontend, making a quick flask API using nginx based on a pre-made image on the Docker hub, and some security practices examples.
